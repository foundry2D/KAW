# KAW
Kha Audio Workstation 

This project is born of the frustration from a sound designer/musicien/Audio programmer having to always change editor environnements and not having 
a quality free and open-source DAW. This project serves this need and aims to innovate in the fields where others don't dare to go 
or other projects have gone but where plagued by other pitfalls or are closed source.

This project draws inspiration from :
- [RAGE audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4GuM15QOFE)
- The UI standard used by certain german DAW's
- [Blue](http://blue.kunstmusik.com/)

## Short-term Goals :
- Have an easy to use audio integration tool for games
- Have an all-in-one tool where you can compose music or sounds and render out directly to your games
- Integrate your sounds in [Armory3D](https://armory3d.org/) and [Foundry2D](https://github.com/foundry2D)
- Be lightning fast

## Long-term Goals :
- Integrate with other game engines or video editors ( i.e. [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), Unity, Unreal etc.)
- Have an audio generative creation tool that can be efficient so it can be used in games
- Have a generative music creation tool
- Create your own synth
- Offer debugging capabilities
